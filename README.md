# Classifix (NOTEBOOK)

#### EXPLORE Data Science Academy Classification Predict

## 1) Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning (ML) model that can accurately classify whether or not a person believes in climate change based on their novel tweet data. The challenge, presented by EDSA (Explore Data Science Academy), aims to provide companies focused on reducing environmental impact or offering sustainable products and services with valuable insights into consumer sentiment regarding climate change. By developing a robust and accurate ML model, companies can gain access to a wide range of consumer sentiments from various demographics and geographic categories. This classification solution will enhance their market research efforts and inform future marketing strategies. Understanding how people perceive climate change and whether they consider it a real threat is crucial for these companies to gauge how their products or services may be received in the market.

The project will involve collecting and preprocessing novel tweet data related to climate change beliefs. Features will be extracted from the text data to represent the content in a suitable format for ML algorithms. Supervised learning techniques will be employed to train the model, allowing it to classify tweets as either believing in climate change or not. Evaluation metrics will be used to assess the model's accuracy and robustness. The outcome of this project will be a valuable tool that enables companies to access and analyze consumer sentiment regarding climate change. The insights gained from the ML model's classification results will inform marketing strategies, product development, and communication efforts, aligning them with consumer beliefs and effectively targeting their intended audience.
